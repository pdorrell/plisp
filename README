This code works fine in Lucid CL and should work in others as well
(except maybe for file extensions mentioned in the build file).  To
use just load the build file and do (ps "file"); this will compile
file.pl to file.ps.

This code is public domain - I don't care what you do with it.  Just
don't bother me!!

Some files have been altered by Philip Dorrell to enable EPS generation,
file inclusion, and to fix up functions passed as arguments. To figure out
what changes I made, download Peterson's original, and do a diff!

These fixes and changes are also public domain.
